This is the README accompanying the source code to the Windows Store port
of Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection, hosted at
<https://github.com/x-sheep/puzzles>.

This source code was forked from the original source available at
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/>. Note that this fork 
has several modifications which cause the original makefiles to no longer work.

Visual Studio 2013 or higher with the Windows 8.1 SDK is required to compile
the desktop version. The phone version requires the Windows Phone 8.1 SDK.
