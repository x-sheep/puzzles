            Portable Puzzle Collection does not require any permissions or capabilities. This means that the app cannot access the internet

            The app can access saved games (.puzzle files) when opened by the user, either through Windows Explorer or by using the Load
            Game option in the app. Saved games can be transmitted by the user with the Save Game or Share Game options in
            the app. The app doesn't read any files that were not explicitly selected by the user.
